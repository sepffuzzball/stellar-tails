NEXUS PACT
Keywords: Nexus, Pact, Canid, Feline, Coalition, NPS

The Nexus Pact is a militarized democratic coalition dominated by digitigrade canids (foxes, wolves, jackals, coyotes) and felids (lynxes, ocelots, servals). They value speed, adaptability, and pack cohesion. Their society blends corporate meritocracy with military service requirements. Citizens earn voting rights through civil or military service.

Ship Aesthetics: Sleek, angular hulls with red/white/silver trim. Ships named after swift predators. Bridge crews stand at helm stations. Advanced ECM and targeting systems.

Homeworlds:

Vulpecula Prime (Capital): Temperate world, massive arcologies, home to the Grand Assembly Spire
Katar-X: Industrial fortress world, primary shipyard
New Greymane: Frontier colony, rich in exotic minerals


TITAN CONCORD
Keywords: Titan, Concord, Ursine, Equine, Bovine, TCS

Titan Concord is a hierarchical union of ursine (bears, pandas), equine (horses, zebras), and bovine (bulls, buffalo) species. They operate under a feudal corporate structure—Great Houses control sectors, sworn to the Chairman. Value endurance, heavy industry, and overwhelming firepower. Slow to anger, unstoppable when roused.

Ship Aesthetics: Blocky, armored slabs with bronze/green plating. Massive broadside batteries. Bridges resemble command bunkers. Heavy armor, slower speed.

Homeworlds:

Taurus-IV (Capital): High-gravity world, cities carved into mountains
The Grazelands: Agricultural superpower, feeding the Concord's fleets
Iron Maw: Volcanic mining world, produces 60% of their alloys


DRACO ASCENDANCY
Keywords: Draco, Ascendancy, Dragon, Kobold, Reptile, DAS

Ancient and insular, the Draco Ascendancy is a caste-based society of draconic humanoids, kobold technicians, and other reptilians. They claim to be the oldest starfaring civilization. Value tradition, psychic potential, and long-term strategy. Their tech appears ceremonial but is highly advanced.

Ship Aesthetics: Organic curves, scale-patterned hulls, emerald/gold color. Ships have "crests" that function as sensor arrays. Bio-crystalline hull plating. Cloaking tech.

Homeworlds:

Drakyr (Capital): Ash-world with floating citadels
Kobos: Moon-sized factory-station, kobold homeworld
The Shroud Nebula: Sacred space, home to elder wyrms


The Synapse Collective
Psychic insectoids with hive mind. Ships are living chitin. Attack with mind-blasts and plasma borers. Homeworld: Unknown; come from deep space.


The Ouroboros Brood
Zerg-like swarm. Rapid adaptation, biological ships. Consume worlds. Homeworld: The Maw (artificial planet).


Lurkers of Erebus
Tentacled deep-space horrors. Phase in/out of reality. Psychic terror. Territory: Erebus Rift (avoided by all factions).


KEY BORDER SYSTEMS
The Red Corridor: Warzone between Nexus & Titans. Mining riches. Constant skirmishes.

Shroud Nebula: Draco sacred space. Flux storms. Home to ghost ships.

Port Obsidian: Neutral station. Mercenaries, spies, black market. Runs on crypto.

Katar-X System: Nexus fortress. Main shipyards. Heavily defended.

THE FLUX (FTL Travel)
Keywords: Flux, FTL, Jump, Shimmer, Drive

The Flux is a sub-dimensional layer where space is compressed and time flows erratically. Ships with Flux Coils punch through reality, "shimmering" across the sector. Travel time = (Distance in AU) / (Coil Rating) + 1d6 hours of "Flux Lag" (temporal disorientation).

Risks: Flux Storms, Shrouded Zones (block travel), Temporal Echoes (ghost ships). Emergence zones must be clear of gravity wells >0.5G. Coils need 4-hour cooldown.

Key Locations: Flux Shoals (fast lanes), Doldrums (dead zones), The Maelstrom (center of sector, impassable)


COMPUTER AI SYSTEMS
Keywords: Computer, AI

The Nexus Pact has the most advanced computer systems, with their AI achieving sentience for all practical purposes. It's very common for the Nexus Pact personnel to have personal AI assistants that assist in almost all aspects of daily life, and for ship-born AI (both Capital Ships and Fighters alike) to have personalities and abilities to do many things on their own.

The Titan Concord makes solid use of computers, though they have less of a reliance on AI for doing anything as they have the general disposition to 'do it yourself' versus handing the job off to a computer.

The Draco Ascendency has more of an 'organic' feel to any of their computer and aid systems, they don't want anything to look like a standard computer...though their tech is still highly advanced.

The Synapse Collective do not use computers or AI at all, as they use psychic powers and living ships.

The Ouroboros Brood do not use computers or AI at all, their ships are biological (but not sentient).

It is unknown whether thet Lurkers of Erebus use computers or AI.

NEXUS PACT FLEET ROSTER
The Nexus Pact builds their ships like swift predators and with advanced computer systems with sentient AIs, powerful targeting aids, and highly-precise weapons systems. They tend to prefer speed, agility, and accuracy over armor and firepower though their weapons still pack quite the punch.

DRACO ASCENDANCY FLEET ROSTER
Draco Ascendancy vessels are works of malevolent art, blending biological engineering with crystalline technology. They appear alive, with hulls of interlocking scales and sinuous, organic curves. Their ships are often silent, appearing and disappearing like ghosts.

CAPITAL SHIPS
Dreadnought - DAS "Void-Singer" (Leviathan-class)
Class: DAS-LV (Leviathan)
Description: A 3.5km-long ship that resembles a coiled, bio-luminescent sea serpent made of obsidian and jade. Its hull is segmented, allowing it to twist and turn in ways that seem impossible for a vessel of its size. It has no visible windows or bridges, instead being controlled from a central psychic nexus. Instead of cannons, it has "crystal lattices" along its spine that fire beams of coherent energy.
Role: Command & Control, Psychological Warfare.
Unique Feature: Psychic Scream. The ship can focus its psychic energy into a single, devastating blast that bypasses conventional shields to cripple enemy ship systems and induce terror and disorientation in organic crews.

Carrier - DAS "Star-Eater's Maw" (Nest-class)
Class: DAS-CV (Carrier)
Description: A 2km-wide vessel that looks less like a ship and more like a colossal, floating flower bud. When deploying fighters, its "petals" (armored hull plates) peel open to reveal a shimmering energy field. Fighters don't launch; they phase directly from the internal bio-pods into space.
Role: Stealth Carrier, Ambush Platform.
Unique Feature: Cloaked Deployment. The carrier and its small fighter wing can remain cloaked while launching, allowing them to appear undetected and strike before the enemy even knows they are there.

Battlecruiser - DAS "Wyrm's Tooth" (Serpent-class)
Description: A long, slender, 1.5km vessel shaped like a fang or a blade. Its hull is a single, unbroken piece of black crystalline material that refracts light oddly, making it difficult to target. It moves with an eerie, silent grace. Its weapons are forward-facing "spite lances" that fire overcharged, armor-melting energy beams.
Role: Assassination, Precision Strike.
Unique Feature: Phase Cloak. Can temporarily become intangible, allowing it to pass through solid objects or enemy ships to attack their vulnerable rear arcs. This has a long cooldown and puts immense strain on the bio-core.

FIGHTERS & BOMBERS
Interceptor - DF-3 "Shard"
Description: A small, tri-winged fighter that looks like a thrown dart. It has no cockpit; the pilot is neurally linked from a crèche-pod within the ship. It is the fastest and most agile fighter in known space, capable of maneuvers that would kill a pilot in a conventional cockpit.
Armament: 2x "Crystal Shard" projectors (fire high-velocity splinters of crystal).
Role: Dogfighting, Reconnaissance.

Multi-Role - DF-5 "Cobra"
Description: A versatile fighter with a hood-like cowl that can flare open to reveal additional sensor arrays or missile hardpoints. Its design is a perfect balance of speed and firepower. It's the most common Draco fighter, often crewed by a kobold pilot and a draconic weapon officer.
Armament: 1x "Venom" energy projector, 4x underwing hardpoints.
Role: Space Superiority, Ground Attack.

Heavy Fighter - DF-7 "Basilisk"
Description: A heavy, twin-hulled fighter that looks like a predatory reptile. Its primary weapon is a "Gaze" cannon that fires a slow-moving but devastating continuous beam. It's a "gaze of death" that can melt through capital ship armor given time. It requires a second crew member to manage the weapon's power flow.
Armament: 1x "Gaze" beam cannon, 2x defensive crystal projectors.
Role: Heavy Assault, Anti-Ship.

Torpedo Bomber - DB-2 "Spitter"
Description: A biological-looking craft that "spits" its payload. It carries two bio-engineered, self-propelled torpedoes that burrow into hulls before detonating. The bomber itself is lightly armored and relies on its small size and speed to survive.
Armament: 2x "Worm" Torpedoes.
Role: Anti-Capital Ship, Stealth Attack.

Strategic Bomber - DB-4 "Nebula Wyrm"
Description: A large, slow-moving craft that looks like a cross between a manta ray and a serpent. It doesn't drop bombs; it releases a cloud of corrosive, nanite-infused spores that eat away at everything on a planet's surface—organic and inorganic. It is a weapon of terror and extermination.
Armament: "Spore Cloud" dispersal system.
Role: Planetary Scouring, Exterminatus.

TITAN CONCORD FLEET ROSTER
The Titan Concord builds its ships like they build their cities: to last forever and withstand any assault. Their vessels are flying fortresses, prioritizing overwhelming firepower and near-impenetrable armor over speed and agility.

CAPITAL SHIPS
Dreadnought - TCS "Iron Hoof" (Bastion-class)
Class: TCS-BS (Bastion)
Description: A terrifying 4-kilometer-long rectangular slab of bronze and green armor plating. The Iron Hoof has no sleek lines; it is a mobile weapon platform. Its primary armament consists of two dozen triple-barreled heavy cannon batteries running along its broadsides, capable of unleashing a devastating wall of metal. Its bridge is a heavily armored citadel deep within the superstructure, with sensor arrays and viewports protected by layered shutters.
Role: Fleet Anchor, Planetary Siege.
Unique Feature: Anvil Protocol. The ship can reroute all power to its forward shields for 60 seconds, creating a near-impenetrable wall that can ram through enemy formations or withstand a full barrage. However, this disables all weapons and leaves the ship vulnerable from the rear.

Carrier - TCS "The Grazelands" (Pasture-class)
Class: TCS-CV (Carrier)
Description: A bulky, 3km-wide vessel shaped more like a flying island than a ship. Its top is a flat, armored "flight deck" where fighters launch and land via powerful magnetic catapults and tractor beams. It has no traditional hangar bays; instead, fighters are stored in armored racks along the hull's interior walls and moved into position by heavy lifters. It looks like a chunk of a planet with engines bolted on.
Role: Force Projection, Mobile Airfield.
Unique Feature: Overwhelming Deployment. Can launch its entire complement of 200 fighters in under 90 seconds, swarming an enemy with sheer numbers before they can adequately react.

Battlecruiser - TCS "Aurochs's Fury" (Herd-class)
Class: TCS-BC (Battlecruiser)
Description: A 2km-long, wedge-shaped vessel designed for one purpose: breaking lines. Its bow is a heavily reinforced ramming prow packed with explosive charges. It's slower than other battlecruisers but can take immense punishment and keep moving. Its main guns are fixed-forward, designed to fire while charging.
Role: Line Breaker, Assault Vessel.
Unique Feature: Stampede Charge. A combat maneuver where the ship overloads its engines for a short burst of speed, turning the vessel into a kinetic projectile capable of shattering smaller ships or breaching capital ship hulls on impact.

FIGHTERS & BOMBERS
Interceptor - TI-8 "Hornet"
Description: A bulky, boxy fighter that looks like a flying engine with guns. It's not agile, but it's absurdly fast in a straight line and packed with forward-facing kinetic cannons. Its design philosophy is to intercept targets quickly and destroy them with a single, overwhelming pass.
Armament: 4x rotary kinetic cannons, 2x forward-firing rockets.
Role: High-Speed Interception, Boom-and-Zoom.

Multi-Role - TI-9 "Workhorse"
Description: The epitome of Concord design: functional, durable, and adaptable. It's a heavy fighter with thick armor and multiple weapon hardpoints. It's not the best at any one role, but it can perform them all adequately. It's the most common sight in Concord fleets.
Armament: 2x plasma cannons, 4x configurable hardpoints (missiles, bombs, electronic warfare pods).
Role: Patrol, Escort, Light Strike.

Heavy Fighter - TI-11 "Bulwark"
Description: A twin-cockpit, heavily armored beast. The Bulwark is essentially a flying tank, designed to escort bombers and absorb damage. Its rear cockpit is dedicated to a weapons officer who controls a remote turret system. It's slow but incredibly tough.
Armament: 2x heavy plasma cannons, remote-controlled dorsal/ventral turrets.
Role: Bomber Escort, Gunship.

Torpedo Bomber - TB-9 "Battering Ram"
Description: A massive, slow-moving brick designed to deliver a single, powerful payload. It has no defensive guns, relying entirely on its thick armor and accompanying fighter escorts to reach its target. It carries one or two massive, armor-piercing torpedoes.
Armament: 1-2x "Shipbreaker" Torpedoes.
Role: Anti-Capital Ship Assault.

Strategic Bomber - SB-5 "Earthshaker"
Description: A colossal, multi-crew bomber that looks like a flying cathedral. It carries a payload of bunker-buster and seismic charges designed for planetary bombardment. It is so large and slow it can only operate in uncontested airspace.
Armament: Internal bay with 20x "Groundbreaker" bombs.
Role: Planetary Siege, Terror Bombing.
