The Iron Hoof has no sleek lines; it is a mobile weapon platform. Its primary armament consists of two dozen triple-barreled heavy cannon batteries running along its broadsides, capable of unleashing a devastating wall of metal. Its bridge is a heavily armored citadel deep within the superstructure, with sensor arrays and viewports protected by layered shutters.\nRole: Fleet Anchor, Planetary Siege.\nUnique Feature: Anvil Protocol. The ship can reroute all power to its forward shields for 60 seconds, creating a near-impenetrable wall that can ram through enemy formations or withstand a full barrage. However, this disables all weapons and leaves the ship vulnerable from the rear.\n\nCarrier - TCS \"The Grazelands\" (Pasture-class)\nClass: TCS-CV (Carrier)\nDescription: A bulky, 3km-wide vessel shaped more like a flying island than a ship. Its top is a flat, armored \"flight deck\" where fighters launch and land via powerful magnetic catapults and tractor beams. It has no traditional hangar bays; instead, fighters are stored in armored racks along the hull's interior walls and moved into position by heavy lifters. It looks like a chunk of a planet with engines bolted on.\nRole: Force Projection, Mobile Airfield.\nUnique Feature: Overwhelming Deployment.

Its main guns are fixed-forward, designed to fire while charging.\nRole: Line Breaker, Assault Vessel.\nUnique Feature: Stampede Charge.

Its hull is segmented, allowing it to twist and turn in ways that seem impossible for a vessel of its size. It has no visible windows or bridges, instead being controlled from a central psychic nexus. Instead of cannons, it has \"crystal lattices\" along its spine that fire beams of coherent energy.\nRole: Command & Control, Psychological Warfare.\nUnique Feature: Psychic Scream. The ship can focus its psychic energy into a single, devastating blast that bypasses conventional shields to cripple enemy ship systems and induce terror and disorientation in organic crews.\n\nCarrier - DAS \"Star-Eater's Maw\" (Nest-class)\nClass: DAS-CV (Carrier)\nDescription: A 2km-wide vessel that looks less like a ship and more like a colossal, floating flower bud. When deploying fighters, its \"petals\" (armored hull plates) peel open to reveal a shimmering energy field. Fighters don't launch; they phase directly from the internal bio-pods into space.\nRole: Stealth Carrier, Ambush Platform.\nUnique Feature: Cloaked Deployment. The carrier and its small fighter wing can remain cloaked while launching, allowing them to appear undetected and strike before the enemy even knows they are there.\n\nBattlecruiser - DAS \"Wyrm's Tooth\" (Serpent-class)\nDescription: A long, slender, 1.5km vessel shaped like a fang or a blade. Its hull is a single, unbroken piece of black crystalline material that refracts light oddly, making it difficult to target. It moves with an eerie, silent grace. Its weapons are forward-facing \"spite lances\" that fire overcharged, armor-melting energy beams.\nRole: Assassination, Precision Strike.\nUnique Feature: Phase Cloak.
