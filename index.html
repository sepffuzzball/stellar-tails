                    <p>Welcome to the Stellar Tails universe, where four major powers vie for control of the galaxy's most valuable territories. Set in the year 2385, this universe follows the desperate struggles and shifting alliances between the Nexus Pact, Titan Concord, Draco Ascendancy, and mysterious alien factions.</p>
                    <p>Travel between systems is accomplished through The Flux, a sub-dimensional layer where space is compressed and time flows erratically. Ships with Flux Coils punch through reality, "shimmering" across the sector while avoiding temporal distortions and Flux Storms that could tear them apart.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="faction-title">Nexus Pact</h3>
                    <p>A militarized democratic coalition dominated by digitigrade canids and felids. They value speed, adaptability, and pack cohesion, with sleek angular ships featuring advanced ECM and targeting systems. Their society blends corporate meritocracy with military service requirements.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="faction-title">Titan Concord</h3>
                    <p>A hierarchical union of ursine, equine, and bovine species operating under feudal corporate structure. They build flying fortresses prioritizing overwhelming firepower and near-impenetrable armor over speed. Their Great Houses control sectors, sworn to a Chairman.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="faction-title">Draco Ascendancy</h3>
                    <p>An ancient, insular caste-based society of draconic humanoids and kobold technicians. They claim to be the oldest starfaring civilization, with bio-crystalline hull plating and cloaking technology. Their organic-curved ships appear alive, with scale patterns and psychic capabilities.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="faction-title">Mysterious Factions</h3>
                    <p>The Synapse Collective are psychic insectoids with hive minds and living chitin ships. The Ouroboros Brood are zerg-like swarms with rapid adaptation and biological ships. The Lurkers of Erebus are tentacled deep-space horrors that phase in/out of reality, wielding psychic terror from their territory in the Erebus Rift.</p>
